      With Neo4j GraphGists you can describe and model your domain in a simple text file (<a href="http://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a>) and render it as a rich, interactive, database-backed page in any browser.

      It is perfect to document a specific domain, use-case, question or graph problem.

  h2 Examples

  p GraphGists work like any AsciiDoc document, but they allow you to insert special comments to define how data from Neo4j can be displayed and interacted with.

  p First define a block of <a href="http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/">Cypher</a> code to setup the database:

  pre
    |
      //setup
      //hide
      [source,cypher]
      ----
      CREATE (:Database {name:'Neo4j'})-[:SUPPORTS]->(:Language {name:'Cypher'})
      ----

  p You can then make queries to the data and output them as a table and/or a graph:

  div
    pre style="float: left"
      |
        [source,cypher]
        ----
        MATCH (db:Database)-[:SUPPORTS]->(language:Language)
        RETURN db.name, collect(language.name)
        ----

        //table

    pre
      |
        [source,cypher]
        ----
        MATCH (:Database)-[rel:SUPPORTS]->(:Language)
        RETURN rel
        ----

        //graph_result


  p You can fork <a href="https://gist.github.com/cheerfulstoic/ba9e1c2225aa5259b10e">this GraphGist template</a> to have something to start working with.

      A reader can explore your GraphGist to read and understand your domain.  A live console is also inserted into GraphGists so that readers can even try out their own queries
      We want to encourage you to model a domain that you know or like and describe it interactively in a GraphGist.

  h2 How do I create a GraphGist?

  asciidoc:
    . Find a great domain (Music, Dating, Comics, Healthcare, Politics, Sciences, ...)
    . Whiteboard a good example graph model.
    . Determine interesting use-cases.
    . Create Cypher statements for setup and query-use-cases.
    . Write a good description and create a useful model picture (using a tool like link:http://gliffy.com[Gliffy] or link:http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/#[Arrows]).
    . Compose it all nicely in your AsciiDoc-GraphGist-file (see link:http://neo4j.com/graphgist/5956246[this GraphGist]).
    . Store it as a link:https://gist.github.com/[GitHub Gist]
    . Submit the URL on the link:/submit_challenge_entry[submission page]

  /h2 GraphGist Challenges

  /p

      There have been two GraphGist challenges so far and we are currently holding another.  Check out our <a href="/challenge/index.html">2015/2016 Winter Challenge</a>!

  /p
    |
      The best way gathering great graph models is to ask your community.
      That's why we already ran two challenges to find interesting ideas for GraphGists with tremendous results.

  /p
    asciidoc:
      The first challenge in September 2013 had link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/wiki#wiki-graphgist-september-challenge-submissions[17 submissions] and link:http://blog.neo4j.org/2013/10/the-first-graphgist-challenge-completed.html?_ga=1.56087459.909862480.1422364624[3 winners].

  /p
    asciidoc:
      Our GraphGist Winter Challenge (Dec 2013-Jan 2014) asked for contributions in 10 categories.
      We got an impressive link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/wiki#wiki-graphgist-winter-challenge-submissions---categories[65 submissions]. Here are the link:http://blog.neo4j.org/2014/02/graph-gist-winter-challenge-winners.html?_ga=1.56087459.909862480.1422364624[winners per category]
